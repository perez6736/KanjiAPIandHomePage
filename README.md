# KanjiAppNoReact
A simple web application that will allow me to enter a text of japanese and tell me data about the kanji chaaracters used. 

Tech used 
Backend
- Node.js 
- Express.js 
- MySQL DB 
 
FrontEnd 
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Javascript 

Since this only cares about the kanji characters in theory it should work for chinese but I am using a dictionary based of the Japanese usage of the characters. 

Things app will be able to do. 
- List most used characters in a block of text 
- Provide detail like meaning, stroke order, and readings of the characters 
- Create a csv file with the characters and definition to make import to anki (flash card app) easier 
- Save a list of overall usage of users inputs in order to analyze what characters are most used overal time 

Hopefully It will be able to support different users 
- provide analytics of kanji usage 
- provide most used vocabulary word from most common kanji 

Future hopes 
- refactor front end to use react.js
